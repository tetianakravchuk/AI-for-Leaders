## Overview

This notebook is designed to:
- Introduce key preprocessing concepts in Python using libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`.
- Demonstrate methods to explore, clean, and manipulate datasets.
- Provide examples for statistical summaries and data visualization.

The notebook also contains interactive tasks to practice data exploration and preprocessing techniques.

## Features

### 1. **Introduction to Key Functions**
   - Learn how to use `info()`, `describe()`, `head()`, and other `pandas` utilities for summarizing and understanding datasets.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing data and poorly formatted dates.
   - Removing duplicates and ensuring unique identifiers.

### 3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Calculating mean, median, mode, and other descriptive statistics.
   - Identifying outliers in the dataset.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
   - Creating scatter plots, histograms, and line graphs using `matplotlib` to analyze trends and patterns.

### 5. **Data Encoding**
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables to prepare data for machine learning models.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

Usage

Running the Notebook
	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>


	2.	Open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook Week_1_Preprocessing.ipynb


	3.	Run each cell sequentially and follow the instructions provided in the notebook.

Example Commands
	•	View dataset structure:

df.info()
df.describe()


	•	Plot age vs. account opening year:

ax.scatter(df["BirthDate"], df["AccountOpened"])

Data Analysis Tasks

The notebook guides you through several hands-on exercises:
	1.	Summarizing Data:
	•	Use info() and describe() to understand dataset structure and statistics.
	2.	Handling Missing Values:
	•	Identify and remove or impute missing data.
	3.	Cleaning Dates:
	•	Ensure date columns are correctly formatted.
	4.	Removing Duplicates:
	•	Check for and remove duplicate rows and identifiers.
	5.	Visual Analysis:
	•	Graph age distribution and account opening trends.
